# About this checkpoint!

## First Of All:

-This is a checkpoint-project to prove that i now know and understand HTML **properly** and **correctly**.

## And:

-This project was made in **2 hours** after learning **HTML** in 2 days.

## Finally:

-I've put this project to W3C Validator to correct the mistakes i got in the file.
-When i first finished the project, i had only 2 errors on the validator, so i fixed them before pushing it in github.
-So, this project has 0 error right now.

**See You!**
