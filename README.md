# Roadmap
## Roadmap to become a Full-Stack Developer.

### -HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
  -It is used on the frontend and gives the structure to the webpage which you can style using **CSS** and make interactive using **JavaScript**.

When i finish **HTML**, i will make a little website to verify that i now understand **HTML**.
  
### -CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
  -It is a language that is used to style the **frontend** of any website. 
  -**CSS** is a cornerstone technology of the **World Wide Web**, alongside **HTML** and **JavaScript**.

When i finish these first two steps, i need to be able to make a **static website**.
So, the first mission is to make a **static website**.
If i can manage to do that ( which i will, because it is pretty much easy ), i will get to the next step.

### -Javascript
  -**JavaScript** allows you to add interactivity to your pages.

My mission when i finish **JavaScript** step is to add interactivity to my page that i've made with **HTML** and **CSS**, and go on to the next steps.

### -npm
  -**npm** is a package manager for the **JavaScript** programming language maintained by **npm**, Inc.
  -It is the default package manager for the **JavaScript** runtime environment **Node.js**.

My mission when i finish **npm** is to be good at using external packages and to be familiar with *package.json* file and know how to use it to manage your project dependencies.
The next steps:

### -git/github
  -Of course, these two are inevitable.
  -While im on the steps before this step, i will be using git/github and push my projects in here.

### -Tailwind Css
  -CSS Framework that provides atomic CSS classes to help you style components.
  -e.g. flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.

### -React
  -React is the most popular front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 
  -React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.

## Well...
  -Now, after all these steps, i should be able to build a complete front-end application, including:
    -Structuring my webpages with HTML.
    -Styling my webpages with CSS.
    -Adding interactivity to my webpages with JavaScript.
    -Using the DOM API to manipulate your webpages.
    -Using the Fetch API to make HTTP requests.
    -Understanding promises and using async/await syntax to write asynchronous code.
    -Installing and using external libraries with npm.
    -Version controlling my code with Git.
    -Pushing my code to GitHub.

## We can now move on to the backend.

**---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

# Backend

### -Node.js
  -Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.

-At this point, my mission is to being able to build CLI applications using Node.js.
-The CLI application should be able to do these:
   -Read and write files.
   -Parse command line arguments.
   -Make HTTP requests.
   -Parse JSON.
   -Use a third-party library (e.g. a library for parsing CSV files).
   -Use a third-party API.

### -PostgreSQL
   -PostgreSQL, also known as Postgres, is a free and open-source relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance.

-At this point, the mission is to being able to build a simple CLI application that interacts with database.

### -REST (REpresentational State Transfer) 
  -It is an architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it easier for systems to communicate with each other.

### -JWT (JSON Web Token)
  -JWT stands for JSON Web Token is a token-based encryption open standard/methodology that is used to transfer information securely as a JSON object. 
  -Clients and Servers use JWT to securely share information, with the JWT containing encoded JSON objects and claims. 
  -JWTs are designed to be compact, safe to use within URLs, and ideal for SSO contexts.

### -Redis
  -Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, message broker, and streaming engine. 
  -Redis provides data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes, and streams. 
  -Redis has built-in replication, Lua scripting, LRU eviction, transactions, and different levels of on-disk persistence, and provides high availability via Redis Sentinel and automatic partitioning with Redis Cluster.

## Congrats!

-At this point, i should have everything that i need to build a complete application that:
  -Has a responsive frontend that users can interact with.
  -Has a backend API that is secured with JWT authentication.
  -Has a database that stores data.
-At this point i should practice building as much as i can on my own to solidify my knowledge.

## Now, we have some DevOps things to learn.

### -Linux Basics
### -Basic AWS Services
-At this point, i should be able to deploy my application to AWS.

### -Monit
-I should now implement monitoring and autorestarts for my application using monit.

### -GitHub Actions
-Now that i have the infrastructure setup, it's time to automate the deployment process. This is where CI / CD comes in.
-The next step at this point is to implement CI/CD for my application using GitHub actions. I should setup a GitHub action that, whenever i push to master, will automatically:
  -Run my tests (ignore this step if you haven't learnt it yet).
  -Deploy my application to AWS.

### -Ansible
-Now that i have learnt ansible, i should be able to use it to automate the deployment of my application.

### -Terraform
-Earlier in the roadmap, i manually logged into the AWS console and had to setup the services. 
-Now that i know terraform, i should go ahead and automate the process of creating the infrastructure for my application using terraform and with that my deployments will be fully automated i.e., i should have:
  -Infrastructure setup using terraform
  -Provisioning using Ansible
  -CI/CD using GitHub Actions
  -Monitoring using Monit

# CONGRATS!
## We can now say that i am literally a Full-Stack Developer!
